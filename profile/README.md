This is the resting place for all my old and abandoned code projects. Just like in a real graveyard, the code here has served its purpose or, for one reason or another, had to be retired. Feel free to explore and reminisce with me.

## 🪦 Graveyard Contents

Here, you'll find a collection of abandoned projects, prototypes, and experiments. Each of them has a story, and while some may have died young, others lived long and fruitful lives before their final commit.

## 💀 In Memoriam

Remember that not all code is meant to last forever. Every project, no matter how small, contributes to your growth as a developer. Though these projects may have passed away, their lessons and experiences continue to guide me in my coding journey.

## 🌱 What's Next?

While some code may rest eternally in this graveyard, new projects are always emerging. Explore my active repositories to see what I'm currently working on. Who knows, maybe one of these projects will become the next resident in this code graveyard.

Feel free to reach out or provide feedback on any project you find here. It's always interesting to revisit the past and learn from it.
